# Container Health Fix Documentation

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Health Check Endpoint Authentication
**Problem**: Docker health check was calling `/api/v1/status` which required authentication
**Solution**: Created public `/api/v1/health` endpoint that returns health status without authentication

### 2. Repository Path Permissions
**Problem**: Container was trying to use `/repos` path without write permissions
**Solution**: Updated all configurations to use `/tmp/repos` with proper permissions

### 3. Docker Configuration Inconsistencies
**Problem**: Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml had mismatched paths and health check endpoints
**Solution**: Synchronized all configuration files

## Files Modified

### routes/api.py
- Added public health endpoint: `GET /api/v1/health`
- Returns `{"status": "healthy", "message": "GitHub Sync Server is running"}`

### Dockerfile
- Updated health check to use `/api/v1/health`
- Changed repository directory from `/app/repos` to `/tmp/repos`
- Updated environment variable `MAIN_PATH=/tmp/repos`

### docker-compose.yml
- Fixed health check endpoint reference
- Updated environment variable `MAIN_PATH=/tmp/repos`
- Corrected volume mapping to `/tmp/repos`

### database.py
- Default repository path set to `/tmp/repos`

## Verification

### Health Check Test
```bash
curl -f http://localhost:5000/api/v1/health
# Returns: {"status":"healthy","message":"GitHub Sync Server is running"}
```

### Repository Sync Test
- Repository cloning and pulling works correctly
- No permission denied errors
- Proper directory structure created

## Container Deployment Status

✓ Health checks passing
✓ Repository operations functional
✓ Web interface accessible
✓ API endpoints secured
✓ Webhook processing operational

## Production Ready

The GitHub Sync Server is now fully operational with:
- Healthy container status
- Correct permission handling
- Proper health monitoring
- Complete repository sync functionality
